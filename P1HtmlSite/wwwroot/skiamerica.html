    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>As someone who skis quite a bit I am always unsure about the weather going to ski resorts in my area. While there are many weather apps for ski resorts, many are over complicated and unintuitive. I strive to create a simple, easy to use weather app for ski resorts all over the United States. The driving idea behind Ski America is to provide fast easy to access weather data for ski resorts near you.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Ski America is an android app designed to provide weather data for ski resorts that you are interested in. As a user of the app you will be able to follow specific ski area/resorts. By following these resorts you will be able to view the weather information on your dashboard. Following a ski resort also gives you the ability to receive notifications when a good storm is moving in, or when the weather conditions line up for a perfect day. The app will provide weather information including cloud cover, temperature, wind speed/direction, and upcoming storms. You will also have the ability to toggle on and off downloads for the 7 day forecasts for ski resorts you follow. The user interface is meant to be simple yet sleek only containing 4 page, the login, the main landing, the settings, and the search page.</p>
